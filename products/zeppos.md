> [Zepp OS](https://docs.zepp.com/docs/intro/) is a health management system for smartwatches and wearable devices that aims to create products and user experiences based on the concept of "creating health value for users".

Major versions of Zepp OS are released every 4 to 6 months but are not always available to update on all devices simultaneously. Certain Zepp OS devices like the Amazfit GTR 4 were recently updated to version 3.5 whereas other devices like the Amazfit Active and Amazfit Balance were updated to version 4 in July 2024.

To know more about the latest running version on individual Zepp OS smartwatches, check the [Zepp OS Version on Devices website](https://docs.zepp.com/docs/reference/related-resources/device-list/) and the [Amazfit Product updates website](https://www.amazfit.com/blogs/product-update).
